# Pega Launcher
### This application was built in the process of learning how to build a React App.   
### I wanted a scenario where I could build something more useful than a Hello World

Clicking on the "hamburger" opens a sidebar with *server specific* to:
* **Demo Support materials found on Pixar**:
    * Demo scripts
    * Videos
    * Documents

* **Demo Links hosted on the server**:
    * UPlus-WSS

### Steps to install and run **Pega Launcher**

Install Node and Yarn on your computer.   I am including links below.   There are many options of where to download them.   I wlll leaved that choice up to you.
* https://nodejs.org/en/download/
* https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install/#windows-stable

Once you have Node and Yarn installed.   Download (or fork) the Github repository.   When expanded it will create a directory "PegaLauncher-master".   Enter it and run the following command:

    yarn install
followed by:

    yarn start

I have created four files which manage the contents of the launcher:
## ServerMap.csv
This file contains the list of server instances with the followint:
* ID
* ServerTitle - this is the **"KEY"** across all the files
* NickName       - this is a readable name defined by the user in the dropdown
* Image-Base     - used for referencing a Pixar named instance
* ServerAddress  - physical address of the instance (typically fully qualified)
* PlaceHolder    - placeholder
* HTTPs          - not used in this current isntance
* Port           - not used in this current isntance
* tags           - placeholder for searching later
* InstanceId     - not used in UI but can record a specific insante id (i--0458397bcd1)
* Copied_From_InstanceId - - not used in UI but can record where instance came from (i--0458393333)

## AutoLogin.csv
* ID
* ServerTitle - this is the **"KEY"** across all the files
* AppBase - Groups the entries within the **TABS**
* Desc - description of login entry
* Role - Role of user
* Username
* Password
* Version - version of Pega
* Scenario - Scenario name placeholder - not used in UI
* Server - Server decription placeholder - not used in UI
* HTTPs  - not used in UI
* Port  - not used in UI
* Email - Email of user (if desired)
* EmailPassword
* isPega - placeholdeder for account on AWS or other sites - not used in UI
* Non-PegaURL - URL for this entry if not on Pega (AWS Email for example)

## ServerLinks.csv
This file contains URI local to the selected server instance.   THe paths will be relative to that server.   Here is an example entry in the file:

    
    3,VM-Local-EESand,TravelCo_ReasonForTravel,/restservice-examples/rest/TravelCo_ReasonForTravel,REST,8.4,VM-Local-EESand
    

The columns in the CSV file
* ID
* ServerTitle
* MaterialDesc
* MaterialURL
* MaterialType
* PlatformVersion


## DemoSupportMaterial.csv
This file contains references to any materail (local or not) to the selected server instance.  The paths are full URL's to the appropriate destination.   Here is an example entry in the file:

    22,PN - E2EBFS83,8.3 Case Management,https://pega.app.box.com/s/v4any1flohg71u5mqf1vovidwkpxf0ph,Doc,8.3

The columns in the CSV file
* ID
* ServerTitle
* MaterialDesc
* MaterialURL
* MaterialType

<!-- 
In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!
